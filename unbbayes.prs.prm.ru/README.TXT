CONFIGURING MAVEN
------------------

The first thing needed is to install the maven project in your computer.

After that, it is necessary to install the maven plugin for your IDE, in this case, the Eclipse IDE.
The update site for this plugin is: http://q4e.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/updatesite/.

Additionally, the unbbayes-code project is required to solve the unbbayes dependency.
