 * Classes implementing this interface represent a tree data structure of value-tree algorithm, 
 * that has root node as the name of the value-tree node.  Each node in the tree can only
 * have one parent, and store any kind of data. The root of the tree is a privileged
 * node that has no parents and no siblings.  Nodes are mainly accessed through
 * their index and method to Ô¨Ånd node index by its name should be implemented
 * in the class.  Initially, the index of a node is returned when it is added to the
 * tree, and should corresponds to the order of addition.
