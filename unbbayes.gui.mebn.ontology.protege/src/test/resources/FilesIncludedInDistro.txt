The following files/folders are included to the distribution file (ZIP) thanks to dist.xml.

These files/folders must not be migrated to src/main/resources, because maven, by default, will include
them in the main JAR file if we do so (we want these resources to be in a separate folder instead).

The src/test/resources folder was chosen for such purpose because it is the only one included
to eclipse's classpath without special configuration, and yet it is
not included in the JAR file (thus, allowing us to run the application on the IDE and still
not to include these resources in the JAR file).
