UnBBayes Around the World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Have you ever heard about UnBBayes? Is this the first time you see it around? Would you 
  like to know what the community think about it?
  
  If not, have you ever used UnBBayes? Have you ever written an article and referenced 
  it? Did you like it?
  
  Well, here we will show some references and comments about UnBBayes. We would love to 
  list all projects and articles that ever used or mentioned UnBBayes, but unfortunately 
  we do not know them all.
  
  If you know any other project, article, link, whatever that used or talked about UnBBayes, 
  please let us know! We, and the community, would appreciate it a lot! Please send us an 
  e-mail (rommel.carvalho@gmail.com) talking about it. We also encourage the curious user 
  to send his/her comment to us. We will try our best to make this open source project 
  better and better.

  Now, the awaited list:
  
  * <Although the above approaches are promising where applicable, a workable solution for 
  the Semantic Web requires a general-purpose formalism that gives ontology designers a range 
  of options to balance tractability against expressiveness. Current research on SW formalisms 
  using first-order probabilistic logics is still in its infancy, and generally lack a complete 
  set of publicly available tools. Examples include PR-OWL (Costa, 2005), which is an upper 
  ontology for building probabilistic ontologies based on MEBN logic, and KEEPER (Pool and 
  Aiken, 2004), an OWL-based interface for the relational probabilistic toolset Quiddity*Suite, 
  developed by IET, Inc. Their constructs are similar in spirit and provide an expressive method 
  for representing uncertainty in OWL ontologies. Costa (2005) gives a definition for 
  Probabilistic Ontologies, develops rules for constructing PR-OWL ontologies in a manner that 
  can be translated into Quiddity*Suite, and describes how to perform the translation. Carvalho 
  et al. (2007) and Costa et. al. (2008) present an open source, Java-based, PR-OWL/MEBN GUI and 
  reasoner package, UnBBayes-MEBN, that greatly facilitates the process of building probabilistic 
  ontologies and reasoning with them.>

  * <However, building MFrags in a probabilistic ontology is a manual, error prone, and 
  tedious process. Avoiding errors or inconsistencies requires deep knowledge of the logic 
  and of the data structures of PR-OWL, since the user would have to know all technical terms 
  such as hasPossibleValues, is-NodeFrom, isResidentNodeIn, etc. In an ideal scenario, many 
  of these terms could be omitted and filled automatic by a software application projected 
  to enforce the consistency of a MEBN model.>
  
    <The development of UnBBayes-MEBN [12, 13], an open source, Java-based application that 
    is currently in alpha phase (public release March 08), is an important step towards 
    this objective, as it provides both a GUI for building probabilistic ontologies and a 
    reasoner based on the PR-OWL/MEBN framework.>

  * <The probabilistic network for the speed decision is generated from the existing data. 
  So instead of building up the network and defining the probability function later on, the 
  data is given and the UnBBayes learning tool [1] generates the nodes and afterward gives 
  the definition of the relations between the nodes, thus the probability functions are 
  calculated.>

    <To the UnB group: to Prof. Marcelo Ladeira, that allowed me several and endless conversations, tips, 
    and references about Bayesian networks, and in the end, gently allowed me to use UnBBayes in this project. 
    Special thanks to Michael Onishi and Rommel Carvalho, students advised by Dr. Marcelo Ladeira, that were 
    always ready and available to answer questions about UnBBayes implementation and use.> (Free translation)
