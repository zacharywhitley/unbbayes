<P><FONT size=5 ><FONT size=3 color=#000000>The UMP-ST consists of four major 
disciplines: Requirements, Analysis & Design, Implementation, and Test. 
These terms are borrowed from the Unified Process with some modifications 
to reflect our domain of ontology modeling instead of software development 
process. </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoBodyText><FONT color=#000000>The figure below depicts the intensity 
of each discipline during the UMP-ST. UMP-ST is iterative and incremental. The 
basic idea behind iterative enhancement is to model our domain incrementally, 
allowing the modeler to take advantage of what was being learned during the 
modeling of earlier, incremental, deliverable versions of the model. 
Learning comes from discovering new rules, entities, and relations that were 
not obvious previously, which can give rise to new questions and evidence that 
might help us achieve
our previously defined goal as well as give rise to new goals. </FONT>

<P class=MsoBodyText><FONT color=#000000>Figure below presents the 
Probabilistic Ontology Modeling Cycle (POMC). This cycle depicts the major 
activities or concepts in each discipline, how they usually interact, and 
the natural order in which they occur. However, as described previously, 
this is not the same as the waterfall model (see [114] for information about 
the waterfall model). I.e., it is not necessary to go through implementation 
to be able to test the model. Besides that, the interactions between the 
disciplines are not restricted to the arrows presented. In fact, it is possible 
to have interactions between any pair of disciplines. For instance, 
it is not uncommon to discover a problem in the rules defined in the Analysis 
& Design discipline during the activities in the Test discipline. In other words, 
although, the arrow just shows interaction between the Test and Requirement 
disciplines, it is possible to go directly from Test to Analysis & Design.
