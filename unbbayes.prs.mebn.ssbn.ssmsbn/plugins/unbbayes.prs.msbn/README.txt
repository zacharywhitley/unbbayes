INSTALLING A UNBBAYES' PLUGIN
------------------------------

This application is a plugin for UnBBayes 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/unbbayes/). 
By extracting the distributed ZIP file, a folder with
the following name-pattern will be created:

"<PLUGIN_NAME>-<VERSION_NUMBER>"

You need only to copy the extracted folder into UnBBayes' "plugins" folder.
Most UnBBayes' distribution have the following folder structure:

UnBBayes
	|- examples
	|- lib
	|- plugins <- [Here is where you put the extracted folder]


USING A UNBBAYES' PLUGIN

Every plugin will become available when you start UnBBayes
or when you click "Plugins > Reload Plugins" menu.

ATTENTION
