<p><font color="#000000" size="3">The UMP-ST consists of four major 
  disciplines: <br>
</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="3">Requirements</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="3">Analysis &amp; Design</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="3">Implementation</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000" size="3">Test</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3">These terms are borrowed from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unified Process</span> with some modifications 
  to reflect our domain of <span style="font-weight: bold;">ontology</span> modeling instead of software development 
  process. </font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font color="#000000">The figure below depicts the intensity 
  of each discipline during the UMP-ST. UMP-ST is iterative and incremental. The 
  basic idea behind iterative enhancement is to model our domain incrementally, 
  allowing the modeler to take advantage of what was being learned during the 
  modeling of earlier, incremental, deliverable versions of the model. 
  Learning comes from discovering new rules, entities, and relations that were 
  not obvious previously, which can give rise to new questions and evidence that 
  might help us achieve
  our previously defined goal as well as give rise to new goals. </font>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font color="#000000">Figure below presents the 
Probabilistic Ontology Modeling Cycle (POMC). This cycle depicts the major 
activities or concepts in each discipline, how they usually interact, and 
the natural order in which they occur. However, as described previously, 
this is not the same as the waterfall model (see [114] for information about 
the waterfall model). I.e., it is not necessary to go through implementation 
to be able to test the model. Besides that, the interactions between the 
disciplines are not restricted to the arrows presented. In fact, it is possible 
to have interactions between any pair of disciplines. For instance, 
it is not uncommon to discover a problem in the rules defined in the Analysis 
&amp; Design discipline during the activities in the Test discipline. In other words, 
although, the arrow just shows interaction between the Test and Requirement 
disciplines, it is possible to go directly from Test to Analysis &amp; Design.
