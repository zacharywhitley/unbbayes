You'll need to have RScript (the command-line application for running R) installed in your computer to run UserActivitySimulator.
Usually, RScript comes in the default R installation, so if you have R installed it should come with RScript already, and the PATH environment variable would be properly configured by the installer.


Parameters that are not specified in the file will have default values. 
You may need to put values between quotes (") if they contain non-alphanumeric characters that are not dot (.), comma (,), hyphen (-), or underscore (_), but it's recommended to use quotes whenever non-alphanumeric characters are used. 
Parameters can be declared in any order.
The following is the description of the parameters to include in the configuration file "UserActivitySimulator.in".

-------------------------------------------------


activity_histogram_file:	CSV file (input) with user activity histogram. The default is "RCP8_ActivityHist.csv" (in the working directory).

raw_user_activity_output:	Name of CSV file (output) with simulated user activity. Default is "userActivity.csv".

transformed_detectors_output:	Name of CSV file (output) with simulated detectors alert days (i.e. transformed data). Default is "detectorsDays.csv".

correlation_data_file_folder:	Name of folder (input) containing CSV files with detectors correlation data (actual data). Default is "CorrelationData". This folder should contain files like RCP8_AlertPairs_MAR.csv and RCP8_AlertPairs_APR.csv.


rscript_program_name:	Name (or path) of program that will execute R script. By default, it's "RScript". If you don't have the PATH environment variable configured for RScript.exe, you must specify the full path here, like "C:\Program Files\R\R-3.3.1\bin\Rscript" (with quotes, because it is not a single word).

rscript:	Name of R script file to be invoked in order to generate the output file from activity file. Default is "RCP8_ComputeAlertDays_Driver.r"

distance_metric_output_file:	Name of output file (which contains a metric of distance between the correlation data and simulated detectors alert days data) to be generated. Default is UserActivitySimulator.out. The content of this file shall be minimized with STIEM.

block_cutoff_percent:	This proportion of users in the histogram will be considered to be in block 1 (histogram of low activity users). The rest will be allocated to block 2 (histogram of high activity users) This is a parameter to be optimized. The default value is 0.8.

days_redraw_user_attitude:	How many days to wait until redrawing the bad/good attitude of user. Users are randomly chosen to be bad or good, but after this number of days the same user will be re-selected to be a bad or good user. Set to negative in order to make an user immutable. This can be an important parameter to be optimized. The default value is 20 (i.e. there is a chance that the user will change the attitude after 20 days).

random_seed:	Seed to be used in random number generator. Long (64bit) number is accepted. Default is the difference, measured in milliseconds, between the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.

block1_tokens_per_detector_good_user:	Comma separated integer list of how many tokens for block 1 a good user has for each detector. An example for 6 detectors would be: "5,70,15,10,90,40". This is an important parameter to be optimized. Default is "15000" for all simulated raw detectors.

block2_tokens_per_detector_good_user:	Comma separated integer list of how many tokens for block 2 a good user has for each detector. An example for 6 detectors would be: "5,70,15,10,90,40". This is an important parameter to be optimized. Default is "3000" for all raw detectors.

block1_tokens_per_detector_bad_user:	Comma separated integer list of how many tokens for block 1 a bad user has for each detector. An example for 6 detectors would be: "5,70,15,10,90,40". This is an important parameter to be optimized. Default is "4000" for all raw detectors.

block2_tokens_per_detector_bad_user:	Comma separated integer list of how many tokens for block 2 a bad user has for each detector. An example for 6 detectors would be: "5,70,15,10,90,40". This is an important parameter to be optimized. Default is "10000" for all raw detectors.

bad_user_prob_by_group_size:	Probability of a user to be a bad user, given each peer group size. The format is <PeerGroupSizeName>:<prob>[,<PeerGroupSizeName>:<prob>]*. For example, "large:0.2,small:0.04,medium:0.0001". This is an important parameter to be optimized. Default is 0.1 for all user group size.

peer_group_size_file:	Path to csv file containing peer group sizes. Default is "rcp7_group_sizes_withTRUE.csv" (the file generated by IDI).

total_users:	Total number of users to simulate. The default is 100 (to avoid overflow of R program).

total_days:	Total number of days to simulate. The default is 60 (to avoid overflow of R program).

first_day:	Which date in activity_histogram_file consider to be the 1st date. Default is 0, but it's suggested to use 163 - total_days.

test_days_threshold:	Number of days for training. Days after this date are used for testing. This is used in PCA. The default value is 36, but this must be strictly smaller than total days.

number_timeblocks:	Total number of time blocks to simulate. It's 6 by default. Changing this value is not recommended (may break compatibility with the R script for PCA).

total_number_detectors:	Total number of detectors. It's 24 by default, but the raw user activity simulator will only simulate half of these (because raw detectors 13-24 for peer groups are undefined).
