Version 1.2.1

Fixed minor bug that happened when individual components of JavaSimulatorWrapper
(e.g. utils.SimulatedUserStatisticsCalculator)
were used individually (by calling their main methods from command line), 
we can pass a csv with empty/blank columns, and
such inputs were generating errors. Now, empty columns are simply ignored.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.2.0

Stratified samples will be used to increase the variance of answers, 
considering the uncertainty coming from data generated by sub-samples.
Additionally, new input format with "Probability" property
(instead of Probability<N>) is supported, 
with backward compatibility (to Probability<N>) as well.


----------------------------------------------------------------


Version 1.1.1

JavaSimulatorWrapper.out will not contain any CR-LF at the end of file.
Additionally, the class for writing JavaSimulatorWrapper.out
stopped using a platform-dependent method for ordering rows in the matrix-like output. 


----------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1.0

Support for "Has_Alert_In_Prob" and "Number_of_Runs" in JavaSimulatorWrapper.in.
Has_Alert_In_Prob of value 1 will assume that Alert is a variable not to be calculated by the simulator,
and it will try load it from the input probabilities (it will assume that
Alert is the last variable--the variable that will have states iterated most).
Number_of_Runs is used to specify how many replications to run. 
Number_of_Runs with a value larger than 1 will result in multiple answers.
The JavaSimulatorWrapper.out file was also modified in order to write multiple answers, in
a matrix-like format.


----------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0

Initial release.
A JavaSimulatorWrapper.jar will be able to read JavaSimulatorWrapper.in file
and output JavaSimulatorWrapper.out file. See samples.
